This project demonstrates text mining and visualization techniques using R. 

The script performs the following tasks:

Load Data
Text Cleaning: Cleans the text data by removing punctuation, numbers, extra whitespace, and common English stopwords. It also applies stemming to reduce words to their root forms.
Document-Term Matrix Creation: Generates a frequency-based document-term matrix and a binary (presence-absence) document-term matrix, converting both to matrices.
Term Frequency Calculation: Computes term frequencies, sorts them in descending order, and stores the results in a dataframe.
Word Cloud Visualization: Utilizes the wordcloud and RColorBrewer libraries to create a visually appealing word cloud of the most frequent terms.
Data Export: Saves the binary document-term matrix to a CSV file for further analysis or use.

This project provides a comprehensive workflow for processing, analyzing, and visualizing text data, making it easier to derive insights from large text datasets. 
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to suit your specific needs.
